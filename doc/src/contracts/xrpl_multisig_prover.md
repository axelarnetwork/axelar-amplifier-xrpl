# XRPL Multisig Prover

Source: [`contracts/xrpl-multisig-prover`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-xrpl/tree/main/contracts/xrpl-multisig-prover).

The XRPL Multisig Prover constructs **fully-canonical XRPL transactions** that the on-XRPL multi sign account submits to deliver Axelar-to-XRPL traffic. On other Amplifier chains the prover only has to produce an `execute_data` blob that the destination chain's gateway will then verify and execute; on XRPL there is no destination contract to do that verification, so the prover's output **is the on-chain transaction itself**. The prover therefore also owns all the XRPL-specific bookkeeping that this implies: a pool of pre-allocated [tickets](../glossary.md#ticket) for parallel out-of-order in-flight transactions, an XRP [reserve](../glossary.md#reserve) budget for the multi sign account, trust line management for receiving local IOUs, and the current/next verifier set view used to populate the multi sign account's `SignerList`.

## What XRPL-specific work this contract absorbs compared to the generic prover

| Concern | Generic Multisig Prover | XRPL Multisig Prover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ConstructProof / signing session lifecycle | Yes | Yes |
| UpdateVerifierSet / ConfirmVerifierSet | Yes (`ConfirmVerifierSet` from voting verifier) | Replaced by `ConfirmProverMessage` (verifier rotation rides a `SignerListSet` confirmation) |
| Output | Encoded calldata for destination chain's gateway | **An XRPL canonical-serialized transaction** (Payment / SignerListSet / TicketCreate / TrustSet) |
| Sequence management | N/A (no per-account nonce on Axelar side) | **Yes**: maintains `AVAILABLE_TICKETS` pool, `NEXT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER`, `LAST_ASSIGNED_TICKET_NUMBER` |
| Fee/reserve budget | N/A | **Yes**: `FEE_RESERVE` tracks the multi sign account's XRP balance budget; `ConfirmAddReservesMessage` credits top-ups |
| Per-token plumbing | N/A | **Yes**: `TrustSet` execute variant for opening trust lines so the multi sign account can receive a local-origin IOU |
| Proof status query | Returns full `ProofResponse` with `execute_data` | Returns `unsigned_tx_hash` plus `Completed { execute_data: signed XRPL tx blob }` |

### General steps

1. The relayer calls `ConstructProof(cc_id, payload)` after the ITS Hub has routed an inbound message into the XRPL Gateway's `OUTGOING_MESSAGES` map.
2. The prover queries the XRPL Gateway for the stored message, decodes `HubMessage::ReceiveFromHub(InterchainTransfer)`, and verifies `data` is empty (XRPL has no executable destination; the multisig prover rejects payloads).
3. It parses the destination as a classic XRPL address, converts the amount into the right [`XRPLPaymentAmount`](../glossary.md#xrp) (drops for XRP, or 54-bit-mantissa + exponent for an IOU), allocates a [ticket](../glossary.md#ticket) from `AVAILABLE_TICKETS`, and builds an XRPL Payment transaction whose `Sequence` field is the allocated ticket.
4. The prover opens a signing session at the generic [`multisig`](multisig.md) contract, passing the XRPL canonical serialization as the message to sign. **Each verifier signs a slightly different digest**, because XRPL multi-signing requires appending the signer's own XRPL account id to the canonical bytes before the SHA-512-half hash.
5. Once quorum is reached, the relayer queries `Proof { multisig_session_id }` and gets back `ProofStatus::Completed { execute_data: <signed XRPL tx blob> }`. It then broadcasts the blob to the XRPL ledger.
6. The relayer's subscriber sees the multi sign account's outbound transaction land on the ledger and reports it back via `VerifyMessages` with a `ProverMessage`. Once the [XRPL Voting Verifier](xrpl_voting_verifier.md) confirms it, the relayer calls `ConfirmProverMessage` which releases the ticket and clears the stored payload.

### General steps

1. The relayer (or governance) calls `UpdateVerifierSet`.
2. The prover queries the [Service Registry](service_registry.md) for the active verifier set for chain `xrpl`. If the diff against the current set exceeds `verifier_set_diff_threshold`, the candidate becomes the prover's `NextVerifierSet`.
3. The prover builds an XRPL `SignerListSet` transaction that mirrors the new verifier set into the multi sign account's on-XRPL `SignerList`, with weights scaled to fit XRPL's `u16` weight field, and a quorum derived from the prover's `signing_threshold`. The transaction is signed by the **outgoing** verifier set.
4. The relayer broadcasts the signed `SignerListSet` to the XRPL ledger. The transaction inclusion is then reported back to Axelar as a `ProverMessage` and confirmed through the standard `VerifyMessages` poll machinery.
5. `ConfirmProverMessage` is called after the poll reaches quorum. The prover promotes `NextVerifierSet` to `CurrentVerifierSet`, calls `RegisterVerifierSet` on the generic [`multisig`](multisig.md) contract so subsequent signing sessions reference the new set, and pushes the new set to the [Coordinator](coordinator.md) via `SetActiveVerifiers` for cross-chain bookkeeping.

## Why ConfirmProverMessage replaces the generic ConfirmVerifierSet

On the generic prover, after a `rotateSigners` calldata is broadcast to the destination chain, the destination's gateway emits a `SignersRotated` event which is verified by the destination chain's voting verifier. `ConfirmVerifierSet` reads that result and promotes the set. On XRPL there is no contract to emit an event: a `SignerListSet` transaction landing in the ledger **is** the event. The prover unifies this with the generic message-confirmation path by treating every prover-built outbound XRPL transaction (Payment, SignerListSet, TicketCreate, TrustSet) as a `ProverMessage` that the [XRPL Voting Verifier](xrpl_voting_verifier.md) polls on. `ConfirmProverMessage` then dispatches on the inner transaction type to release the ticket, promote the verifier set, refresh available tickets, or activate a trust line.

## Tickets, sequence numbers, and fee reserve

XRPL has a strict per-account `Sequence` (like an EVM nonce). To allow multiple in-flight bridge transactions and out-of-order confirmation, the prover uses **tickets**: pre-allocated sequence numbers from a pool of up to 250.

| Transaction type | Sequence field | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment | Ticket | Many in flight; can confirm out-of-order |
| TicketCreate | Plain sequence | Refills the ticket pool; must be strictly ordered |
| SignerListSet | Plain sequence | Verifier set rotation; one at a time |
| TrustSet | Plain sequence | One trust line at a time |

The `FEE_RESERVE` counter (in XRP drops) tracks the multi sign account's available XRP. Every new transaction is gated by `ensure_sufficient_fee_reserve` against `xrpl_base_reserve + xrpl_owner_reserve * (251 + trust_line_count) + tx_fee`. `ConfirmAddReservesMessage` is called after the [XRPL Voting Verifier](xrpl_voting_verifier.md) confirms an operator-initiated XRP top-up.
